Prepare this project to be Netlify-ready up to static deployment preparation (Step 3), while securely enabling Gemini chatbot support via a user-provided API key.

This prompt must STOP after Netlify readiness and Gemini key setup. Do NOT deploy or refactor further.

GOALS:
1. The app must build as a static frontend.
2. The Gemini chatbot must be supported.
3. The Gemini API key must be securely requested from me and stored using Replit’s secrets/environment system.
4. The app must NOT break if the Gemini key is missing.

TASKS:

1. Static Frontend Readiness (Netlify Step 1–3)
- Ensure `npm run build` generates a static `dist` directory.
- Ensure the frontend does NOT depend on `server/index.ts` at runtime.
- The backend server must NOT be required for production.
- Any backend-dependent features must fail gracefully.

2. SPA Routing Support (MANDATORY)
- Add support for client-side routing on Netlify.
- Create ONE of the following:
  a) `public/_redirects` with `/* /index.html 200`
  OR
  b) `netlify.toml` with an SPA redirect rule.

3. Environment Variable Safety
- Audit all environment variable usage.
- Guard access so missing environment variables do NOT crash the app.
- Use defensive checks before reading env values.

4. Gemini API Integration (CRITICAL)
- Integrate Gemini chatbot support using an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- The Gemini API key must NOT be hardcoded.
- The key must NOT be exposed in frontend bundles.

5. Ask User for Gemini API Key
- Prompt me to enter my Gemini API key.
- Store the key securely using Replit Secrets / environment variables.
- Confirm that the key is stored as `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

6. Gemini Availability Handling
- Before initializing Gemini, check whether `GEMINI_API_KEY` exists.
- If the key exists:
  - Enable full Gemini chatbot functionality.
- If the key is missing:
  - Do NOT crash the app.
  - Show a clear chatbot UI message:
    “Poke Enviro is unavailable until a Gemini API key is configured.”

7. Local & Netlify Compatibility
- The app must run locally with or without the Gemini key.
- The app must deploy on Netlify without requiring the Gemini key at build time.
- Gemini should activate only at runtime when the key is present.

RESTRICTIONS:
- Do NOT deploy the backend.
- Do NOT refactor UI or features.
- Do NOT expose secrets to client-side code.
- Do NOT proceed beyond Netlify Step 3.

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- `npm run build` succeeds.
- `dist/` directory exists.
- App loads without backend.
- SPA refresh works.
- Gemini works when key is present.
- App does not crash when key is missing.

STOP AFTER COMPLETING THESE TASKS.
